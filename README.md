# C++ Fast octree traversal
The implementation includes an Octree and an efficient Octree traversal algorithm for an offline ray-tracing renderer. The renderer utilized is proprietary, hence only the code for my Octree class and the algorithm is provided. 

The traversal algorithm is implemented based on a paper ["An Efficient Parametric Algorithm for Octree Traversal"](
